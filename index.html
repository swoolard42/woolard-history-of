   <div class="Bio">
     <header>The Man Himself</header>
       <p>Steven Allan Spielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on December 18th, 1946. As a child, Spielberg quickly developed an interest in filmmaking, and by his teen years won a prize at a film festival for his 40 minute war film Escape to Nowhere (1962). As he got older he continued to create small budget films, and one called Amblin' (1968), caught the eye of a producer at Universal Studios. This allowed Spielberg to move into directing television, as well as attending college at California State College. His first two features, Duel (1971), and The Sugarland Express (1974) showed his capability as a director, and landed him his next job on Jaws. After the major success of Jaws, Spielberg continued to craft excellent work through the rest of the 70's and the 80's. These works included Indiana Jones, E.T., and more. Each of these films made him more and more successful, becoming one of the leading directors of the second half of the 20th century.

           <header>Jaws (1975)</header>
           <p>Jaws was Spielberg's first commercially successful film. It's popularity created the term summer 'blockbuster', and helped paved the way for his career. The film is about 3 guys who are forced to hunt down a man eating shark terrorizing a small vacation town during 4th of July weekend. The film stars Roy Schieder, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw. The production is infamous for having trouble with the animatronic shark, which eventually forced them to use more economic filmmaking styles to get the desired shots. The film went on to receive Oscars nominations, including Best Picture.

           <p>Close Encounters was Spielberg's next feature after the success of Jaws. It is his first foray into science fiction, and includes another great score by John Williams. This is where he begins to find himself in his films, with great hallmark Spielberg moments. The film stars Richard Dreyfuss and Melinda Dillon, and is about an alien visit that Dreyfuss's character become enthralled with. The film was released in late 1977, and at the time was buried in the success of Star Wars earlier in the year. That being said, it has become a bit of a hidden gem, especially in Spielberg's filmography.

           <header>Jurrasic Park (1993)</header>
           <p>Jurassic Park was Spielberg pushing the envelope of visual effects. The dinosaur scenes, and especially the T-rex chase, are still some of the most impressive VFX shots in cinema. The film is also a great adventure flick, and still includes a heart warming story at the center of it. Another box office hit, making over 1 billion dollars. The work ILM did on this film changed filmmaking forever, and pushed the medium forward into a more digital age. It is known to have inspired other filmmakers to make their films using this new technology, including George Lucas (who was inspired to create the Star Wars prequels).

           <header>New Hollywood</header>
           <p>Spielberg was one of the pioneers of this new era of filmmaking in America. New Hollywood was a film movement that came about during a time when Hollywood was losing touch with America's youth. These new Hollywood directors gained notoriety due to their young age, which allowed them to connect more directly with the audience. This era also began a push for more individualist films that are controlled by the director, which is a change from the previous producer-driven system from the past. These films also changed the subject matter, leaning more towards more rebellious screenplays, and ones that would've been considered too inappropriate prior to the 60's and 70's. Other directors like Spielberg who are a part of this era are Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma, John Carpenter, George Lucas, Ridley Scott, David Lynch, and many more.
